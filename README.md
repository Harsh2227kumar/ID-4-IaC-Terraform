# âœ… Task 3: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform & Docker

This task was part of my DevOps internship where I provisioned a Docker container using **Terraform** on my Windows PC. I applied Infrastructure as Code principles to automate container deployment.

---

## ðŸš€ What I Did

- Installed **Terraform CLI** on my Windows machine.
- Ensured **Docker Desktop** was installed and running.
- Configured Docker Engine to allow Terraform to communicate via named pipe (`npipe://`).
- Created a GitHub repository and cloned it locally.
- Created the `main.tf` Terraform configuration file to:
  - Define the Docker provider.
  - Pull the `nginx:latest` image.
  - Create and start a Docker container exposing port 8080.
- Used **WSL (Ubuntu)** terminal to run Terraform commands.
- Ran `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` to provision the container.
- Verified the container was running and accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
- Captured screenshots and console logs for evidence.
